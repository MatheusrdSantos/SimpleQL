# Adding plugins

To handle server-side logic and custom behaviours, you can add plugins that we provide, or create your own if you like.

## Provided plugins

We provide the following plugins. More are coming!
1. [Login Plugin](plugins/login.md)
2. [Security Plugin](plugins/security.md)

## Express middleware and error handler

As a matter of facts, you can also provide [express middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html) and an [error handler](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/error-handling.html) directly when creating the server. They will be merged with the plugins middlewares.

```javascript
const app = express();
const middleware = (req, res, next) => next();
const middlewares = [middleware];
const errorHandler = (err, req, res, next) => next(err);
createServer({app, tables, database, rules, plugins, middlewares, errorHandler});
```

## Create your own plugin

['middleware', 'onRequest', 'onProcessing', 'onCreation', 'onDeletion', 'onResult', 'preRequisite', 'errorHandler'];
A plugin consist in an object containing the following optional properties:

 * **preRequisite** : A function that will make sure that the plugin is correctly configured.
 * **middleware** : A middleware that might intercept the whole request.
 * **onRequest** : An object containing functions being called before any request in a specific table.
 * **onProcessing** : An object containing functions being called after the execution of every depending request, but before any changes have been applied to the current results.
 * **onCreation** : An object containing functions being called each time an element is created into a specific table.
 * **onDeletion** : An object containing functions being called each time an element is deleted from a specific table.
 * **onResult** : An object containing functions being called after a request was resolved in a specific table.
 * **onError** : An object containing functions being called when a request failed to resolve in a specific table.
 * **errorHandler** : A middleware able to handle errors generated by this plugin before being sent to the user.

### Prerequisite

This should be a function taking the tables as a parameter. It should then return a Promise that would reject if the plugin configuration is wrong given the provided tables. For instance, if the `userTable` that have been provided upon creation is actually not present in the `tables` object.

```function preRequisite(tables) { return Promise.resolve(); }```

### middleware

This is exactly an [express middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html).

```function middleware(req, res, next) { return Promise.reject().catch(next).then(() => next()); }```

### onRequest

This is an object describing all the functions that should be called when a request starts on any table. It will receive the [onEvent parameters](#onevent-parameters) as second parameter.

```javascript
const onRequest = {
    User : (request, {parent, query, local, isAdmin}) => Promise.resolve()
}
```

### onProcessing

This is an object describing all the functions that should be called after the depending requests, the `get` and `create` instructions have been resolved, but before the `set`, `delete`, `add` and `remove` instructions have been executed. The results are the elements found in the database that match the constraints up to now. It will receive the [onEvent parameters](#onevent-parameters) as second parameter.

```javascript
const onProcessing = {
    User : (results, {request, parent, query, local, isAdmin}) => Promise.resolve()
}
```

**Notice:** This won't be called when using `readOnly` option in `query`.

### onCreation

This is an object describing all the functions that should be called when an object is created inside any table. It will receive the newly created object, and [onEvent parameters](#onevent-parameters) as second parameter.

```javascript
const onCreation = {
    User : (createdObject, {request, parent, query, local, isAdmin}) => Promise.resolve()
}
```

### onDeletion

This is an object describing all the functions that should be called when an object is deleted from any table. It will receive the list of deleted objects and [onEvent parameters](#onevent-parameters) as second parameter.

```javascript
const onDeletion = {
    User : (deletedObjectsArray, {request, parent, query, local, isAdmin}) => Promise.resolve()
}
```

### onResult

This is an object describing all the functions that should be called when a request has been fully executed in any table. It will receive the list of results matching the request, and [onEvent parameters](#onevent-parameters) as second parameter.

```javascript
const onResult = {
    User : (results, {request, parent, query, local, isAdmin}) => Promise.resolve()
}
```

### onSuccess

This callback is called when the whole request will succeed and the changes will be committed to the database. It will receive the [onEvent parameters](#onevent-parameters) as second parameter. It is probably not recommanded to throw an error at this point.

```javascript
const onSuccess = (results, {request, query, local, isAdmin }) => Promise.resolve()
```

### onError

This callback is called when the whole request will fail and the changes made to the database will be rolled back. It will receive the [onEvent parameters](#onevent-parameters) as second parameter.

```javascript
const onError = (error, {request, query, local, isAdmin}) => Promise.resolve()
```

### errorHandler

This is an [express errorHandler](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/error-handling.html).

```function middleware(err, req, res, next) { return next(err); }```


## onEvent parameter

The onEvent parameter consist of an object containing the following properties

 * **request** : The request currently being executed.
 * **parent** : The parent of the request currently being executed.
 * **isAdmin** : A boolean indicating if the current request is being executed as an administrator.
 * **query** : A function that you can use to make a SimpleQL query to the database.
 * **local** : The current request local variables (like authId). You can read them or edit them directly through this object.

### parent

This is the parent of the current request part.

Consider the following request:

```javascript
    {
      Feed : {
        participants : [
          { email : 'user1@email.com' },
          { email : 'user2@email.com' },
        ],
        comments : {
          add : {
            create : true,
            content : 'test',
            title : 'Test',
            author: {
              email : 'user2@email.com',
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
```

This request will create a comment inside the `Comment` table, and add this comment to the Feed table. The `parent` of the `Comment` request is the `Feed` request. This will be the value of `parent`:

```javascript
      {
        participants : [
          { email : 'user1@email.com' },
          { email : 'user2@email.com' },
        ],
        comments : {
          add : {
            create : true,
            content : 'test',
            title : 'Test',
            author: {
              email : 'user2@email.com',
            }
          }
        }
      }
```

### isAdmin

This is a boolean indicating if the current request is being executed with admin rights. You can use this to avoid looping into your event handler. Especially for `onRequest` and `onResult`

### query

The query function provided can be used to make SimpleQL requests to the database. This function takes 2 parameters: the SimpleQL request, and an optional object having the following properties:

 * **admin** *(boolean : default false)* : indicate that the request should be made with admin credentials. Be careful, this will ignore all access rules.
 * **readOnly** *(boolean : default false)* : indicate that the request should only read data and is not allowed to make any change to the database.

### local

This objects provide the local variables used through the request. You can read the values or edit them by updating the object. Right now, the only parameter that you can change is the `authId`.

For instance:

    local.authId = privateKey; //This will make the request executed with admin rights from now on.

This would make the complete request being executed as `admin`. (this should be avoided at all cost!)
